The workflows allow the user to spend more time **thinking**, i.e. running benchmarks or experiments, analyzing the data, and taking decisions, rather than programming/testing/debugging their own scripts.

It consists of *BASH* and *PYTHON* scripts that can be launched locally (serial or with GNU parallel) or on a compute cluster via PBS.
* **DockFlow** : Docking and Virtual Screening
* **ScoreFlow** : Rescoring using PLANTS, Vina, or MM(PB,GB)SA
* **ReportFlow** : Extensive data analysis and reporting tool
* **MDFlow** : Molecular dynamics of multiple systems on SLURM cluster (PBS soon)
* and other usefull tools !

# :package: Installation

Clone or download the latest version of ChemFlow to it's destination, open a terminal and run the `install.sh` script located inside ChemFlow's directory.
```sh
cd ~/software
git clone https://github.com/IFMlab/ChemFlow.git
cd ChemFlow
./install.sh
```
It will create a `CHEMFLOW_HOME` variable, and add the necessary executables to your path.
 Once this is done, you should check the `ChemFlow.config` file for missing paths or to change default behaviour.

# :warning: Requirements for ReportFlow

We do not provide any of the licensed softwares used by ChemFlow. It is up to the user to acquire and install PLANTS, Vina, Amber, Python 3 and the other softwares that might be added in future releases of ChemFlow.

[PLANTS](http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/pharmazie-und-biochemie/pharmazie/pharmazeutische-chemie/pd-dr-t-exner/research/plants.html) and [SPORES](http://www.mnf.uni-tuebingen.de/fachbereiche/pharmazie-und-biochemie/pharmazie/pharmazeutische-chemie/pd-dr-t-exner/research/spores.html) are both available under a free academic license.
ReportFlow makes heavy uses of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) through Jupyter-Notebook. It requires the following Python packages to run seamleslly :
* **jupyter**
* **matplotlib**
* **numpy**
* **pandas**
* **scikit-learn**
* **scipy**
* **seaborn**

# :package: Installation of Required packages
```
pip install jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn scipy seaborn
```
A tutorial on how to install python packages with PIP is available [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
We strongly advise the user to install [jupyter_contrib_nbextensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions) to improve the functionality of the notebooks.

Paths to some of the softwares executables (PLANTS, SPORES, Vina, Amber) should be added in the `$CHEMFLOW_HOME/ChemFlow.config` file.
