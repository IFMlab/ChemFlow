**chemflow_dataset.xlsx**:

The dataset used in this work. For each entry, the PDB code, the experimental binding affinity, the MMGBSA score, the UniProt code of the protein and the SMILES of the ligand are given.

**chemflow_ligands_mol2_bcc.tar.gz**:

3D structures of ligands with AM1-BCC charges used in this study in MOL2 format.

**chemflow_ligands_mol2_resp.tar.gz**:

3D structures of ligands with RESP charges used in this study in MOL2 format.

**chemflow_receptors_pdb.tar.gz.aa..ad**:

3D structures of the proteins used in this study in PDB format.
The PDBs were splitted in four tar.gz files and you can open them to generate the original folder with the following command:
