# For the Bioinformatics 2018 we'll demonstrate DockFlow and ScoreFlow for at least 100 protein-ligand complexes.

## This dataset was obtained from Didier Rognan, and used many times, noticeably in Kellenberber2004.

## Protein and ligand structures were carefully prepared using Sybyl
* I'm concerned about protonation states since I noticed ASP25 of HIV-1 protease (1aaq) are not properly protonated.
* However, I double checked with Schrodinger Maestro 2018.1, which uses PropKa and sidechain flips, and it's optimized protonation suggests the same state as Sybyl.

# The structure database used as input, is like that:
DATASET/${receptor}
where ${receptor} is the PDBid

* Each folder contains: 

| File | Description | 
| ligandX.mol2 | Ligand from crystal structure |
| ligandr.mol2 | Ligand with randomized dihedrals | 
|  protein.pdb | Protein structure from PDB |
| protein.mol2 | Protein prepared with Sybyl |
|     site.pdb | Binding site |

# Top comply with ChemFlow standards we should keep the proposed:
${project}.chemflow/${ChemFlow_module}/${protocol}/${receptor}/${ligand}/

# BUUUUUT for this I'd keep the SAME structure, because we did not agree on a final structure.
