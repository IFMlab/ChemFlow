# HG<i>Flow</i> - Host-Guest Molecular Dynamics Workflow 
... and Toy System Playground !!!
Copyright (c) 2017 Diego Enry B. Gomes and Marco Cecchini

HG<i>Flow</i> is a complete workflow to investigate Host/Guest systems. 

The workflows are divided in 4 parts:
1 Setup
(* Docking - future relase, using Dock<i>Flow</i>)
* Parametrization
* Simulation setup

2 Simulation - A single complex simulation or 3 independent simulations (complex, host, guest)
* Minimization
* Heating and Equilibration
* Production

3 Analysis
* Post-processing, imaging, RMSD, RMSF, Radgyr...
* Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) using Cecchini's model. 
* Molecular Mechanics - Poisson-Boltzman + Solvation Area
* Molecular Mechanics - Generalized Born + Solvation Area

4 Reporting ( offered by Report<i>Flow</i> ) 
* Energies, 
* Center of Mass
* Correlation with experiment
(requires little user intervention)
